# Automation Hub — Build Status

Tracks progress against the build priority in `Automation_Hub_Blueprint.md`.

| # | Automation | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Setter EOD → Discord | ✅ Live | Deployed to Railway, verified end-to-end: a real Setter EOD submission posted to `DISCORD_SETTER_EOD_CHANNEL_ID`. |
| 2 | Weekly Check-in → Discord | ✅ Live | Deployed to Railway, verified end-to-end: a real Weekly Check-in submission posted to `DISCORD_WEEKLY_CHECKIN_CHANNEL_ID` (a separate channel/server from #1, at the user's request). |
| 3 | Discord ID field + Friday reminder DMs | ✅ Live | `WEEKLY_REMINDER_ENABLED=true` set on Railway and confirmed on 2026-09-09; deployment stable. First real send: Friday 2026-09-11, 12:00 PM ET (`America/New_York`, DST-aware). 19 of 22 active clients backfilled with a Discord ID; Wylie Hawkins, Malachi Hardware, Patric Cocos have `Skip Weekly Reminder` checked (bible-study-only clients, no personal-branding access, confirmed with the user). Message: "Hey [First Name], time for your Weekly Check-in — [link]". Dry-run path (`npm run weekly-reminder-dry-run`) still available for testing future changes without risk. |
| 4 | New-member onboarding flow | 🟡 Built, not yet enabled | Welcome message copy provided by the user (`src/onboarding/welcomeMessage.js`) plus an appended email-ask line, needed for matching but not in the original copy. All-in-one message (not a sequence), channel = `firstname-lastname` (slugified, no parent category), visible to member + CSM role + bot (COO/CMO skipped — already Administrator, so they see everything anyway). Team "new member joined" notification explicitly dropped per the user — they want a separate Whop-based notification with purchase amount instead (not built). Gated behind `NEW_MEMBER_ONBOARDING_ENABLED` (unset on Railway — **not live**). Still needed to go live: `DISCORD_CLIENT_GUILD_ID` + `DISCORD_CSM_ROLE_ID` env vars, two Privileged Gateway Intents enabled in the Discord portal, standing "Manage Channels" for the bot in the client server, and `AIRTABLE_PAT` upgraded to include `data.records:write` (first automation in this hub that writes to Airtable). |

Deployed on Railway (Hobby plan — chosen over Render because this service runs
continuously in the background and Render's free tier spins down idle services,
which would have silently killed the poller/bot connection). Both automations
were confirmed live on 2026-09-09 by creating a real record in each Airtable
table and watching the Discord message arrive.

One setup wrinkle worth knowing for #3/#4: both Discord servers lock channels
down per-category, so inviting the bot didn't grant it visibility into private
channels (`DiscordAPIError[50001]: Missing Access`). Fixed once with
`scripts/grant-bot-channel-access.js` — see the README section on it. Any
*new* category created later will need the same one-time grant repeated.

## How #1 and #2 work

Airtable Automations has no built-in "call an external URL" action and no Discord
action (checked via the Airtable automation-builder tool's action catalog before
building), so this hub polls the Airtable REST API on an interval instead of
depending on Airtable-side webhooks. Each automation tracks a per-table "last seen"
timestamp in `data/state.json` (`STATE_FILE_PATH`) and only notifies about records
created after that mark. See the "State persistence" note in `README.md` for the
one operational caveat this creates on ephemeral hosting disks.

## Whop integration for #4 — deferred, not rejected

The client server already has a "Whop Bot" role/integration installed
(discovered while scoping #4), but the user didn't set it up and doesn't know
what it currently does. Considered using it to auto-capture email at
purchase instead of asking in Discord, but deferred for this build:
unclear whether it's Whop's native Discord role-sync (simpler, different
design) or would need a custom webhook + purchase/join correlation (a real
second integration, no shared ID between a Whop purchase and a Discord join
event). #4 ships with the reply-with-email version first; investigating what
the existing Whop Bot role actually does, and whether it's worth wiring in,
is a genuine follow-up once #4 is proven live — not scoped here.

## Open item carried over from the blueprint

The "EOD Reports" base (`appO76t48mwkC3j80`) overlaps with gaps documented in
`05_Sales_Pipeline_Blueprint.md` (touchpoint counts) and `06_Operations_Pipeline_Blueprint.md`
(Stage 5 at-risk/churn). A separate session should pull it into a proper schema
reference doc and reconcile it against both blueprints — still out of scope here.
